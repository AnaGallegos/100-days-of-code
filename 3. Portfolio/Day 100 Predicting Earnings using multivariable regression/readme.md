# Day 100

Used the famous National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 to run a Multivariable Regression to predict salaries. How are earnings determined and what does this imply from government policy?

## Predicting Earnings using Multivariable Regression
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 dataset is one of the most important databases available to social scientists working with United States data. 

It enables researchers to examine factors that affect earnings and educational attainment and has enormous policy relevance. It can also shed light on politically sensitive topics like the disparities in salaries and educational attainment between people of different sexes, ethnicities, and other characteristics. We can create better government policies when we have a better understanding of how these factors impact education and earnings.
